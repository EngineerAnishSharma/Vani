# Vani App

## Brief Overview

Vani is a speech restoration app designed to assist individuals in regaining their speech abilities. It incorporates a gamified experience to make the rehabilitation process engaging and rewarding.

## Game Ideas

### Level-based System

The app features a level-based system where users progress through increasingly difficult challenges. Higher difficulty levels correspond to more significant speech restoration milestones, and users earn stars based on their performance.

### Mini Games with Voice Control

Introduce mini-games where users control objects using voice commands. This not only adds a fun element but also enhances the user's ability to control their speech.

### Word Recognition Challenge

Users are presented with a video and corresponding sound. The challenge is to select the correct word from a matrix of options. This game not only aids in word recognition but also rewards users with stars.

### Playground Examples


#### Bandlab Style Audio Mixer

Create an audio mixer game inspired by Bandlab, utilizing basic phonetic sounds. Users can experiment with mixing sounds, contributing to their speech rehabilitation while earning stars.

#### Animated Text-to-Speech Playground

Allow users to type any text into a field, and the app converts it into an animated sequence and corresponding sound. This playful feature not only engages users but also earns them stars.

### Earning Stars

Every game, except playgrounds, contributes to users earning stars. The number of stars earned is directly tied to the difficulty level and the user's performance.
